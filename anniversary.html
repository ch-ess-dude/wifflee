well it was before i met you.
well it still is,
but the uncertainty doesnt seem so scary,
with the certainty of you.
world tours together,
going to galas and jazz bars together,
waking up together,
swimming together,
you see the common word? together.
because you make everything better.
even this annoying distance,
you make it feel almost invisible,
with your love filling the gap.
love, another confusing thing,
but for me, with you,
im quite sure,
and i can say for certain that i love you,
more than anything else in the world,
and to conclude, heres to a lifetime of us.">
